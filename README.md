# 100-Days-of-Code

100 Days of Code is a coding event being organized by the CSI SRM NCR Chapter  and it is aimed at improving the problem solving skills of those who participate through consistent practice of questions every day for a hundred days.

Start:  Saturday, March 22, 2023<br>
End:    Monday, June 30, 2023

The questions are picked from Leetcode and the submissions have to be done on individual Leetcode accounts as well as on CSI's GitHub repository "100-days-of-Code".

In case of an issue, an allowance to miss one day per 7 days (or some other privilege) maybe considered, but backlogs have to be settled on by the participant later on in addition to making up for them by being consistent before the event duration ends.
